## How to use the API
### Create Trips
Make a HTTP POST petition to http://localhost:3000/trip <br>
You need to send the information of the trip in a Json format to the body.
This is a format example:
```
{
    "tripName": "Europe Popular Capitals",
    "type": "Land Trip",
    "duration": "3 days",
    "cities": ["Madrid", "Paris", "London"],
    "details": ["Hotel Best Madrid 3*", "Hotel Worst Paris 4*"]
}
```
All fields are required<br>
You can only send two "type" of trip "Land Trip" or "Air Trip"<br>
The "cities" array need at least 2 items.<br>
The  "details" array only acept 2 items as a requirement.<br>

### Edit and Delete a trip
You can edit or delete a trip using the Id of the trip.<br>
You can see all trips and the trip Id making a HTTP GET petition to http://localhost:3000/trips <br>
Edit Trip:<br>
Make a HTTP PUT petition to http://localhost:3000/trip/ID <br>
Replace the "ID" of the URL with the real Id of the trip.
You need to send by the body in a Json format all the tripÂ´s information. (The format is the same as to create a new trip).<br>
Delete a Trip:<br>
Make a HTTP DELETE petition to http://localhost:3000/trip/ID <br>
Replace the "ID" of the URL with the real Id of the trip.

### Find Trips
Make a HTTP POST petition to http://localhost:3000/search <br>
You need to send the information of the trip in a Json format to the body.
This is a format example:
```
{
    "cities": "Barcelona",
}
```
The app will search and display the trips found in the database.<br>
The app takes at least three letters from standard input to execute the search.<br>
You can search with uppercases or lowercases.<br><br>
I leave in the root directory of the project a collection of postman to carry out load tests and search for trips.<br>
